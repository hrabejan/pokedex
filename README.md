# Pokedex application

This is a simple application that fetches Pokemon data via [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) service and loads this data in a paginated manner.<BR/>
The data is displayed as a card, showing each Pokemon's ID number (with leading zeros if possible), name, it's traits and image.<BR/>
Every Pokemon item is clickable and will redirect the user to a details screen containing more information about the specific Pokemon (mostly placeholder in this case).<BR/>
